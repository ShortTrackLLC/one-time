# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This change log follows the conventions of [keepachangelog.com](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]
### Notes
- Bump minimum Clojure version to 1.10.0 (because it's the minimum version supported on officially supported Java LTS releases)
- Drop running tests for Clojure 1.6 & 1.7
- Add running tests for Clojure 1.10.1, 1.10.2, 1.10.3, 1.11, 1.11.1, 1.12.0-alpha1 (in addition to 1.8 & 1.9)
- Update all the dependencies to the latest versions accordingly
- Start using Github Actions for running tests across a matrix of ubuntu, macos, windows & java 8, 11, 16, 17
- Drop Travis config
- An intermediate unreleased version had an attempt at (constant) time safe
  comparision of tokens introduced in #11. This change introduced a subtle
  vulnerability (see #12 for details). The following commits in the `main`
  branch are vulnerable:

  * d69435b4d91769a8f84ecd0e32ebda607fc9de85
  * 60d161c525a1b750fff28d4adcc5c2cc7597cf4c
